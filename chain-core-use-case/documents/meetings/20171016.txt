Result:


Enabling mutliple chain cores to work together.

Trying chain as big player in blockchain

One blockchain per US state or country. Otherwise not scalable.
Try chain core testnet, test if two chains can interact, can you join other chain, can you share chains. Otherwise it is not distributed.
Write abstract!!!

Send models so both can take a look at them

Ivy allows comtting from one chain to other.
Basically you retire token from one chain core and then add it to other (referencing the hash from the first chain core will make them tied together).

Next time:
